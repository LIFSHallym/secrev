# Welcome to the revolution
The Cybersecurity Revolution is a global, 24 hour, online conference focusing on ways to improve global cybersecurity.

## Why a global, online conference?
Cybersecurity practitioners and researchers are spread across the world. Getting everyone together is time-consuming and costly. This conference is a first effort to bring together the best in cybersecurity to share ideas using the power of the Internet.
